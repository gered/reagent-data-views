# reagent-data-views

Reagent components that can subscribe to receive realtime database updates.

### This library is still in the experimental stages! ###

I'm hoping to have a release with documentation and examples soon. For now, tread
carefully when browsing through the code in this repository!

This requires the use of my fork of the [views](https://github.com/gered/views) library
(which is also currently in the experimental stage).
