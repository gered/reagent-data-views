# reagent-data-views

TODO: Update this. This library, while I think it's pretty darn awesome, uses out of date libraries (the views library in particular is waaaaaay old, no one would want to use this version now). Plus a bunch of dependencies (including the aforementioned views library) are not on Clojars, so a bunch of manual installations in is necessary to use this at the moment.
